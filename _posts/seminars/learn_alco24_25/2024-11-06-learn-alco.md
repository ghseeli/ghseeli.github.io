The main goal of this talk is to find the coefficients of the reduced characteristic polynomial of a matroid as the mixed intersection numbers of hyperplanes (\\(\alpha\\) classes) with reciprocal hyperplanes (\\(\beta\\) classes).  I will begin by reviewing the Chow ring of wonderful compactifications and studying honest intersections.  Then we will survey a few combinatorially arguments which show a similar formula holds for general matroids.
