The Grassmannian Gr(k,n) has a stratification into positroid varieties which can be indexed by many objects including move-equivalence classes of reduced plabic graphs and bounded affine permutations. Given a bounded affine permutation f, the positroid variety \\(\Pi_f\\) and the corresponding positroid cell \\(\Pi_{f,\geq 0}\\) in the TNN Grassmannian form a positive geometry \\((\Pi_f, \Pi_{f,\geq 0})\\). We will see how to compute the canonical form of a positroid variety using a reduced plabic graph corresponding to that variety.
