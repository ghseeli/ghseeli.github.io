In this talk we first introduce another way of constructing new matroids from a given one M, by minimizing the linear functional \\(w \cdot x\\) over \\(x\\) in the matroid polytope of \\(M\\), for a fixed \\(w \in \mathbb{R}^n\\). We then use this to define the Bergman fan of a given matroid, which are spaces of weights \\(w\\) whose corresponding matroids do not contain loops. To understand the topology of the Bergman fan, we introduce a combinatorial gadget called phylogenetic trees which can be used to parametrize the Bergman fan, and give a nice subdivision of it.
