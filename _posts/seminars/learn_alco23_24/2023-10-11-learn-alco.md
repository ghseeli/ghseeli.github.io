Projectivizations of pointed polyhedral cones \\(C\\) are positive geometries with canonical forms that look like \\(\Omega_C(x) = \frac{A(x)}{B(x)}dx\\) with \\(A, B\\) polynomials. We are going to see that the numerator \\(A(x)\\) is given by the adjoint polynomial of the dual cone \\(C^\vee\\), which cancels unwanted poles outside the polytope.
