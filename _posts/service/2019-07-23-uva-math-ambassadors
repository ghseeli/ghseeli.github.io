I volunteer as a [UVA Math Ambassador](http://indorgs.virginia.edu/MathAmbassadors/) to do math outreach in Charlottesville area grade schools. Our main goal is to provide educational activities that expose students to math outside of the traditional K--8 curriculum and to encourage fun analytical exploration. Some of our more popular activities are exploring [Mobius strips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) and learning about [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
