During these unprecedented times, I have seen a number of creative alternatives to in person talks. One of these solutions is the [Junior Mathematian Research Archive](https://sites.google.com/view/jmra/home). Essentially, early career researchers can propose to submit a video about a paper they have recently submitted to arXiv. So, I figured I would give it a shot and gave a short talk about part of my paper with Jonah Blasiak and Jennifer Morse on [\\(K\\)-theoretic Catalan functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01759).

In this talk, I try to give an idea about where \\(K\\)-theoretic Catalan functions come from and how they might be useful. Our motivating example was to show that \\(K\\)-\\(k\\)-Schur functions, \\(\\{g_\lambda^{(k)}\\}\_{\lambda \in Par}\\) are a subclass of these functions and to prove some conjectured properties. In this talk, my main example is \\(k\\)-branching, which is showing the \\(g^{(k+1)}\_{\mu}\\)-expansion of \\(g^{(k)}\_{\lambda}\\) has coefficients that are alternating by degree.
