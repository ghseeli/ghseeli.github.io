I gave a series of three virtual talks in the [Important Papers in Algebraic Combinatorics Seminar](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~jhaglund/IPAC/index.html) about the paper "A raising operator formula for Macdonald polynomials," joint with Jonah Blasiak, Mark Haiman, Jennifer Morse, and Anna Pun. In the first two lectures, I gave background and set the scene for the tools that we used to prove this formula. In the third, I presented the actual formula and gave some ideas about how to think about it.

Abstract: In the theory of symmetric functions, it is customary to give
both combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of various important
bases. Perhaps the most notable example is the Schur function basis,
which can be described as a weight generating function of semistandard
tableaux of a given shape, but also via the Weyl Character Formula.
Equally important are rules governing how to write certain distinguished
bases in terms of other bases. Many classical examples of these change
of basis rules appear in combinatorial forms, often using variations of
semistandard tableaux formulas. However, another old but useful form of
these change of basis rules occurs using the lesser known concept of
"raising operators." In particular, there are raising operator formulas
relating Schur functions and complete homogeneous polynomials, but also
Schur functions and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Indeed, raising
operator formulas for Hall-Littlewood polynomials in terms of Schur
polynomials can expose some nice properties that may be difficult to see
via other methods.

Modified Macdonald polynomials serve as a generalization of many
important bases of symmetric polynomials, including Hall-Littlewood
polynomials. However, despite much study over the last 30 years, raising
operator formulas for modified Macdonald polynomials remained absent. In
this series of talks, I will discuss an explicit raising operator
formula for Macdonald polynomials my collaborators and I posted in July
2023.
The talks will start with putting raising operators on a rigorous
footing and demonstrate how to work with them via examples. Next, we
will discuss modified Macdonald polynomials purely in combinatorial
terms via the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula and introduce LLT polynomials
from a combinatorial perspective. Finally, we will discuss how to
combine the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula with a raising operator formula
for a the Macdonald \\(\nabla\\) operator applied to LLT polynomials in order
to recover the desired raising operator formula for Macdonald
polynomials. Time permitting, we will also further discuss nice
properties this raising operator formula exposes and how it also gives a
new generalization of Macdonald polynomials.
