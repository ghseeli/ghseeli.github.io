In this talk I will will be looking at toric geometry from a symplectic point of view. We will begin by looking at symplectic manifolds. There are natural actions of Lie groups on such manifolds and we will define certain maps called moment maps. In the case of torus actions, we will discuss results by Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg and Delzant, relating convex polytopes and toric manifolds, via moment maps.
