I sometimes make contributions to the open source mathematical software <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, the most notable of which was overhauling the <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.html">diagram algebras package</a> with my collaborators as a result of my work on Brauer algebras. You can see all the <a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=ghseeli&noquickjump=1&ticket=on">tickets I have contributed to</a> the <a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/">SageMath trac server</a>.
