In this talk I will introduce the weak Bruhat order \\(W_n\\) on \\(S_n\\) and the strong Sperner property of Posets and show that \\(W_n\\) is strongly Sperner with approaches from two different works. Stanley conjectured an order rising operator \\(U\\) on \\(\mathbb{C}W_n\\) and showed that if \\(U^{r-2k}\\) is invertible then \\(W_n\\) is strongly Sperner. In the first work, Gaetz and Gao constructed an order lowering operator \\(D\\) which led to an \\(sl_2\\) representation of \\(\mathbb{C}W_n\\) and used representation theory of \\(sl_2\\) to prove invertibility. In the second work, Speyer et al. proved a determinantal formula of \\(U^{r-2k}\\) conjectured by Stanley, through showing that the divergence operator acts on Schubert Polynomials as the operator \\(U\\) and this implies invertibility of \\(U^{r-2k}\\).
