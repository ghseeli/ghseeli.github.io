To prove log convexity of certain sequences of numbers, one wants to realize those numbers as intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on some varieties. We will introduce one kind of such varieties called wonderful compactifications. 

This construction compactifies the complement of hyperplane arrangements with nice boundary divisors. We will discuss two ways of constructing them, via ‘manually adding normal directions’ and via blow-up.
