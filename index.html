		<p>I am a Mathematics PhD student at the <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> studying algebraic combinatorics while keeping open arms towards representation theory and algebraic geometry; I am currently working under <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/people/jlm6cj/">Dr. Jennifer Morse</a>. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist on real time bidding problems for an internet advertising company. Generally, I am interested in working on unsolved problems and enabling other problem solvers to be more effective. </p>

	<h2>Writings</h2>
		<p>I have one mathematics research paper that has been accepted for publication at Lâ€™Enseignement Math&#233;matique from work I did as an undergraduate at Loyola University Chicago with Dr. Stephen Doty and Dr. Aaron Lauve. The preprint is available on arXiv here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08900">Canonical idempotents of multiplicity-free families of algebras</a></p>
		<p>As a resource for my cohort of graduate students, but also for other learning graduate students, I worked with various collaborators on creating class notes for first and some second year PhD program courses. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-notes">First year course notes</a>.</p>
		<p>I also publicly post monographs I write for myself to clarify concepts and fill in details of books I read. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/monographs">Monographs</a>; I also have made select notes for more advanced classes I have taken, but they are more likely to have errors and some are incomplete: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/class-notes">Advanced course notes</a>.</p>
	<h2>Teaching</h2>
		<p>I have taught (non-math major) calculus courses at UVA as a graduate student instructor. I (and fellow collaborators) create "notesheets" for students which you can view here: <a href="https://mareoraft.github.io/MATH-Calc/">Notesheets</a></p>
		<p>I believe in engaging in flexible pedagogy; that is, I am open to questioning my own pedagogical assumptions, especially when they are challenged by research. I also highly value creating an inclusive and welcoming learning environment both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
