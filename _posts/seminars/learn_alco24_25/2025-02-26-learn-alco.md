We will define the volume polynomial of a graded Poincaré duality algebra and see that it encodes the graded Poincaré duality algebra. In the case where the graded Poincaré duality algebra comes from the Chow ring of a loopless matroid, we introduce the Dragon Hall-Rado formula, giving a combinatorial formula for the volume polynomial.
