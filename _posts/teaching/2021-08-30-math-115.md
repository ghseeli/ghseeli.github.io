This course is a standard calculus class taught using "Calculus: Single Variable" by Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et. al. Furthermore, this course is taught using  "flipped classroom" model: students are given assigned reading to complete before arriving to class on the material they will use in class. In class, students are given worksheets of problems to complete in groups.
