I will state the g-theorem characterizing the face numbers
of simplicial polytopes, and discuss some related notions in
commutative algebra: face rings, M-vectors, Cohen-Macaulay rings, etc.
Then, time-permitting, I'll briefly explain the relation to toric
varieties that we've been discussing this semester.
