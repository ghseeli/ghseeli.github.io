My dissertation shares a significant overlap with the paper by the same name, but includes some additional results and conjectures.
Most notably, in Chapter 4, I provide a combinatorial proof of the so-called "k-rectangle rule" to the conjectured formula for closed \\(K\\)-\\(k\\)-Schur functions, using the techniques developed in the previous chapters.
Ikeda, Iwao, and Naito subsequently proved the conjectured formula is true and thus give a different proof of the k-rectangle rule via work of Takigiku.
In Chapter 5, I provide some conjectures related to Type C \\(k\\)-Schur functions, giving a conjectured combinatorial formula for them in terms of certain kinds of tableaux, reminiscient of the affine type A combinatorics, as well as a conjectured "raising operator" style formula.
