I am a member of and webmaster for the UVA [Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)](http://math.virginia.edu/awm/). AWM works to encourage girls and women to study and have active careers in the mathematical sciences and promote equal opportunity and equal treatment of girls and women in the mathematical sciences.

The UVA chapter of AWM is incredibly. I try to attend as many AWM events as possible, including invited speaker talks with discussions afterwards, community building lunches and coffees, and group study hours. I also work with AWM members to leverage the website to meet their goals, such as creating a blog to provide more information about the various events AWM hosts.
