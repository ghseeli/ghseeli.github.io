SageMath Permutation Tutorial
====

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free and open source computer algebra system. For this tutorial, we will use a website called [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) which allows you to use SageMath from your web browser.

Using CoCalc
----

1. Go to [https://cocalc.com/](https://cocalc.com/) and sign up for an account.

    </details>
1. Once you log in, you will be presented with your "Projects" page. Click "Create New Project" and call it "Algebraic Combinatoric Class" or something else descriptive for yourself.

    - Name it "test"
    - Select "Sage worksheet" for the type

    </details>
1. Now it should open the worksheet automatically with a single cell. Type "2+2" and then hit "Shift+Enter". It should output "4".
