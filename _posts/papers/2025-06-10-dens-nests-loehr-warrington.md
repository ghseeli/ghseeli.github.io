Abstract: In a companion paper, we introduced raising operator series called
*Catalanimals*.  Among them are *Schur Catalanimals* which
represent Schur functions \\(s_{\mu }(X^{m,n})\\) in alphabets
corresponding to copies of the algebra of symmetric functions inside
the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and Schiffmann.

Here we obtain a combinatorial formula for symmetric functions given
by a class of Catalanimals that includes the Schur Catalanimals.  Our
formula is expressed as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials, with terms
indexed by configurations of nested lattice paths called *nests*,
having endpoints and bounding constraints controlled by data called a
*den*.

Applied to Schur Catalanimals for the alphabets \\(X^{m,1}\\) with \\(n=1\\),
our `nests in a den' formula proves the combinatorial formula
conjectured by Loehr and Warrington for \\(\nabla^m s_{\mu }\\) as a
weighted sum of LLT polynomials indexed by systems of nested Dyck
paths.  When \\(n\\) is arbitrary, our formula establishes an \\((m,n)\\)
version of the Loehr-Warrington conjecture.

In the case where each nest consists of a single lattice path, the
nests in a den formula reduces to our previous shuffle theorem for
paths under any line.  Both this and the \\((m,n)\\) Loehr-Warrington
formula generalize the \\((km,kn)\\) shuffle theorem proven by Carlsson
and Mellit (for \\(n=1\\)) and Mellit.  Our formula here unifies these two
generalizations.
