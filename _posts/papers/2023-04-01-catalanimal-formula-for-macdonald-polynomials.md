This serves as an extended abstract for the full paper titled "A raising operator formula for Macdonald polynomials."
This extended abstract was published in Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire in Issue 89B, Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on "Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics," after the submission was accepted as a talk at the conference (FPSAC) that I gave.
The final published version is available [here](https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/FPSAC2023/85.pdf).
