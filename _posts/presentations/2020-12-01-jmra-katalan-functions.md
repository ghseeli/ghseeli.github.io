During these unprecedented times, I have seen a number of creative alternatives to in person talks. One of these solutions is the Junior Mathematian Research Archive. Essentially, early career researchers can propose to submit a video about a paper they have recently submitted to arXiv. So, I figured I would give it a shot and gave a short talk about part of my paper with Jonah Blasiak and Jennifer Morse on \\(K\\)-theoretic Catalan functions.
