About
---
This course is a standard calculus class taught using Stewart's calculus textbook. Furthermore, this course is taught using a "flipped classroom" model: students are given assigned reading, video lectures, and comprehension questions to compelte before arriving to class on the material they will use in class. Then, in class, the students are given worksheets of problems to complete in groups. Students have opportunities to present problems to the class and I give mini-lectures on an "as-needed" basis. 

The syllabus provides some details on research suggesting that such a model has lead to better learning outcomes for students learning calculus, using benchmarks like the "Calculus Concept Inventory."
