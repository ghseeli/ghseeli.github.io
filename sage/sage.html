For my research, I am a frequent user of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), an open source mathematical software program (or collection of programs) based on the Python programming language.

I also occasionally contribute code to SageMath because it is open source! If you are interested in contributing code to Sage, check out <a href="sage_checklist">my development checklist</a> and feel free to contact me if you have questions!
