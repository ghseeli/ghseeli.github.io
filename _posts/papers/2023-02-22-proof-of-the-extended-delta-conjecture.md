Abstract: We prove the Extended Delta Conjecture of Haglund, Remmel, and Wilson, a combinatorial formula for \\(\\Delta_{h_l} \\Delta_{e_k}' e_n\\), where \\(\\Delta_{e_k}'\\) and \\(\Delta_{h_l}\\) are Macdonald eigenoperators and \\(e_n\\) is an elementary symmetric function. We actually prove a stronger identity of infinite series of \\(GL_m\\) characters expressed in terms of LLT series. This is achieved through new results in the theory of the Schiffmann algebra and its action on the algebra of symmetric functions.
