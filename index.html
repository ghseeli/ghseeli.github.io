		<p>I am a Mathematics PhD student at the <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> studying algebraic combinatorics while keeping open arms towards representation theory and algebraic geometry; I am currently working under <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/people/jlm6cj/">Dr. Jennifer Morse</a>. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist on real time bidding problems for an internet advertising company. Generally, I am interested in working on unsolved problems and enabling other problem solvers to be more effective. </p>

		<p>Think we have met before? Here is my professional past and present <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/travel">travel schedule</a>.</p>
	<h2>Research and Writings &bull; (<a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/research/research.html">Papers</a>)</h2>
		<p>Also, as a resource for my cohort of graduate students, but also for other learning graduate students, I worked with various collaborators on creating class notes for first and some second year PhD program courses. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-notes">First year course notes</a>.</p>
		<p>I also publicly post monographs I write for myself to clarify concepts and fill in details of books I read. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/monographs">Monographs</a>; I also have made select notes for more advanced classes I have taken, but they are more likely to have errors and some are incomplete: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/class-notes">Advanced course notes</a>.</p>
	<h2>Teaching</h2>
		<p>I have taught (non-math major) calculus courses at UVA as a graduate student instructor. I (and fellow collaborators) create "notesheets" for students which you can view here: <a href="https://mareoraft.github.io/MATH-Calc/">Notesheets</a></p>
		<p>I believe in engaging in flexible pedagogy; that is, I am open to questioning my own pedagogical assumptions, especially when they are challenged by research. I also highly value creating an inclusive and welcoming learning environment both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
	<h2>Engagement, Outreach, and Service</h2>
		<p>I am a member of and webmaster for the UVA <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/awm/">Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)</a>. AWM works to encourage girls and women to study and have activer careers in the mathematical sciences and promote equal opportunity and equal treatment of girls and women in the mathematical sciences.</p>
		<p>I volunteer as a <a href="http://indorgs.virginia.edu/MathAmbassadors/">UVA Math Ambassador</a> to do math outreach in Charlottesville area grade schools.</p>
		<p>I sometimes make contributions to the open source mathematical software <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, the most notable of which was overhauling the <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.html">diagram algebras package</a> with my collaborators as a result of my work on Brauer algebras. You can see all the <a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=ghseeli&noquickjump=1&ticket=on">tickets I have contributed to</a> the <a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/">SageMath trac server</a>. If you are interested in contributing code to Sage, check out <a href="sage/sage_checklist">my development checklist</a> and feel free to contact me if you have questions!</p>
		<p>Previously, I have been a mentor for the UVA Math Department <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/drp/">Directed Reading Program (DRP)</a>. The DRP pairs undergraduates interested in learning math outside the standard curriculum with graduate student mentors who guide them in reading some interesting and different mathematics.</p>
