About
---
This course is a standard calculus class taught using Stewart's calculus textbook. Furthermore, this course is taught using an "inquiry based learning (IBL)" model, sometimes referred to as a "flipped classroom." The syllabus provides some details on research suggesting that such a model has lead to better learning outcomes for students learning calculus, using benchmarks like that "Calculus Concept Inventory."
