Abstract: The plethystic transformation \\(f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]\\) and LLT polynomials are central to the theory of symmetric Macdonald polynomials.
In this work, we introduce and study nonsymmetric  *flagged LLT polynomials*. 
We show that these admit both an algebraic and a combinatorial description, that they Weyl symmetrize to the usual symmetric LLT polynomials, and we conjecture that they expand positively in terms of Demazure atoms. 
Additionally, we construct a nonsymmetric plethysm operator \\(\Pi_{t,x}\\) on \\(\mathfrak{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\\), which serves as an analogue of \\(f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]\\).
We prove that \\(\Pi_{t,x}\\) remarkably maps flagged LLT polynomials defined over a signed alphabet to ones over an unsigned alphabet. 


Our main application of this theory is to formulate a nonsymmetric
version of Macdonald positivity, similar in spirit to conjectures of
Knop and Lapointe, but with several new features.  To do this, we
recast the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula for nonsymmetric Macdonald
polynomials \\(\mathcal{E}\_{\mu }(x;q,t)\\) as a positive sum of signed flagged
LLT polynomials.  Then, after taking a suitable stable limit of both
\\(\mathcal{E}\_{\mu }(x;q,t)\\) and \\(\Pi_{t,x}\\), we obtain modified nonsymmetric
Macdonald polynomials which are positive sums of flagged LLT
polynomials and thus are conjecturally atom positive, strengthening the
Macdonald positivity conjecture.
