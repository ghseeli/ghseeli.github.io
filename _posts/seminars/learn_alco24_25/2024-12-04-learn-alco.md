In this talk we introduce the volume polynomial of a Poincare duality algebra and discuss what it has to do with volume. We will introduce mixed volumes of polytopes and the Alexandrovâ€“Fenchel inequality and discuss some classical combinatorial applications of this inequality. These applications directly motivated much of the material that we've covered this semester.
