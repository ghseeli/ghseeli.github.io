Abstract: We prove and extend the longest-standing conjecture in "\\(q,t\\)-Catalan
combinatorics,' namely, the combinatorial formula for \\(\nabla^m s_{\mu
}\\) conjectured by Loehr and Warrington, where \\(s_{\mu }\\) is a Schur
function and \\(\nabla\\) is an eigenoperator on Macdonald polynomials.

Our approach is to establish a stronger identity of infinite series of
\\(GL_l\\) characters involving *Schur Catalanimals*; these were
recently shown by the authors to represent Schur functions \\(s_{\mu
}[-MX^{m,n}]\\) in subalgebras \\(\Lambda (X^{m,n})\subset \mathcal{E}\\) 
isomorphic to the algebra of symmetric functions \\(\Lambda\\) over \\(\mathbb{Q}
(q,t)\\), where \\(\mathcal{E}\\) is the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and
Schiffmann.  We establish a combinatorial formula for Schur
Catalanimals as weighted sums of LLT polynomials, with terms indexed by
configurations of nested lattice paths called *nests*, having
endpoints and bounding constraints controlled by data called a 
*den*.

The special case for \\(\Lambda (X^{m,1})\\) proves the Loehr-Warrington
conjecture, giving \\(\nabla^m s_{\mu }\\) as a weighted sum of LLT
polynomials indexed by systems of nested Dyck paths.  In general, for
\\(\Lambda (X^{m,n})\\) our formula implies a new \\((m,n)\\) version of the
Loehr-Warrington conjecture.  In the case where each nest consists of
a single lattice path, the nests in a den formula reduces to our
previous shuffle theorem for paths under any line.  Both this and the
\\((m,n)\\) Loehr-Warrington formula generalize the $(km,kn)$ shuffle
theorem proven by Carlsson and Mellit (for \\(n=1\\)) and Mellit.  Our
formula here unifies these two generalizations.
