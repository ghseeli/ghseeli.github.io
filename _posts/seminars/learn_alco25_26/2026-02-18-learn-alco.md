Last time we saw that we can describe torsion classes of quiver representations of Type \\(A_n\\) by bracket vectors. In this talk, I will give some more general approaches to describing torsion classes, First I will illustrate them through the familiar Type \\(A_n\\) example. I will also demonstrate how to use them to describe the torsion classes of the representations of the Kronecker quiver. In the second part of the talk, I will use these new descriptions to construct a dual notion of torsion classes, the torsion free classes, and prove that torsion classes form a complete lattice.
