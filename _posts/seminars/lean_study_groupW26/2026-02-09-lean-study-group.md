In this session, we spent time going through the `lean_lec_feb9.lean` file in the `lean_lectures` folder of the [Github repository](https://github.com/ghseeli/michigan-lean-study-group). In particular, we reviewed tactics found in the [Natural Numbers Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de), stepped through a proof that the sum of the first `n` odd natural numbers is equal to `n^2`, and live coded a proof of [`FiniteField.prod_univ_units_id_eq_neg_one`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/Finite/Basic.html#FiniteField.prod_univ_units_id_eq_neg_one), including demonstrating the `refine` tactic.
