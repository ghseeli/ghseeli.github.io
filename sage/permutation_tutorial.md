SageMath Permutation Tutorial
====

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free and open source computer algebra system. For this tutorial, we will use a website called [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) which allows you to use SageMath from your web browser.

Using CoCalc
----

1. Go to [https://cocalc.com/](https://cocalc.com/) and sign up for an account.

1. A project is a collection of documents and worksheets. Create a new worksheet by clicking the blue (+) icon on the top left. 
    ![CoCalc Files Page](../img/cocalc-files-3.png)
    - Name it "test"
    - Select "Sage worksheet" for the type
