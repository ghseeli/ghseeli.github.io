We construct divisors of the wonderful compactification of the complement of hyperplane arrangements and sketch the computation of the cohomology ring. This motivates the Chow ring of matroids, in which we introduce special degree one elements and study the multiplication behavior of flags of flats. We will also work out examples of Chow rings of matroids.
