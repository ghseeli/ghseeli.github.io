It is known when we call a poset \\(P\\), a \\(\mathcal{P}\\)-chain permutational poset, given a subset of permutations
\\(\mathcal{P}\\) of the symmetric group \(S_n\).
In this work, we use the same idea to study subsets of words of length \\(n\\), that are not necessarily permutations, for example: especially when they are certain classes of restricted
growth functions induced by set partitions in standard form over \\([n] = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\\). Varying \\(n\\) only, and
also varying \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) (the number of blocks of the set partitions) simultaneously, we can show that those
posets form a projective system of trees and lattices.
These poset structures can be extended over signed
restricted growth functions for standard type B set partitions over \\(\langle n \rangle = {−1, −2, \ldots, n, 0, 1, 2,\ldots, n}\\) as
well. We investigate properties of the tree and lattice structures of these projective systems.
