The singular locus of a Schubert variety \\(X_v\\) is determined by its smoothness at the \\(T\\)-fixed points indexed by permutations \\(u\\) less than \\(v\\) under the Bruhat order. We construct an affine open neighborhood around each \\(u\\) in \\(X_v\\), decompose it into a product of an affine variety with some affine space. We define a combinatorial relation on pairs of permutations called interval pattern embedding, generalizing the usual notion of pattern embedding. Finally, we show how the open neighborhoods associated with different pairs of u<v are related when interval embedding occurs. This helps us reformulate known results on singular locus of Schubert varieties.
