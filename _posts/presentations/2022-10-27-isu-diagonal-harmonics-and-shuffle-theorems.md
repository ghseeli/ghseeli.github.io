Abstract: The algebra of multivariate symmetric polynomials over the rational numbers has been used
by mathematicians for hundreds of years and contains rich combinatorial structures. In the 1980’s, a
basis of symmetric polynomials called Macdonald polynomials was introduced with extra parameters
that, when specialized, recover various classical bases. The theory of Macdonald polynomials has given
rise to many curious identities relating algebraic quantities arising from representation theory with the
combinatorics of Dyck paths. The first such identity, relating the bigraded character of the so-called
"module of diagonal harmonics” to the combinatorics of Dyck paths lying below a line of slope -1,
was conjectured in 2005 and proven in 2018. Recently, many generalizations of this identity have been
proven by relating the action of an Elliptic Hall algebra with various infinite sums of symmetric Laurent
polynomials. I will start with an overview of symmetric polynomials and how to get symmetric function
expressions from spaces of harmonic polynomials. Then I will move on to discussing various shuffle
theorems and the framework that has led to their proofs. A good part of this talk should be accessible
to undergraduate Math majors and is based on joint work with Jonah Blasiak, Mark Haiman, Jennifer
Morse, and Anna Pun.
