We will show that for projective simplicial toric varieties, the Chow group is isomorphic to its cohomology, thus showing various corollaries such as relating Betti numbers and the number of cones in the associated fan. Finally, we will show a description of the cohomology ring in terms of generators and an ideal of relations.
