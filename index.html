		<p>I am a mathematics researcher working in algebraic combinatorics while keeping open arms towards representation theory and algebraic geometry. Currently, I am an NSF Postdoctoral Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/">Univeristy of Michigan</a>; I received my PhD in Mathematics at the <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> working under <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/people/jlm6cj/">Jennifer Morse</a>. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist on real time bidding problems for an internet advertising company. Generally, I am interested in working on unsolved problems and enabling other problem solvers to be more effective. </p>

	<h2>Research and Writings &bull; (<a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/research/research.html">Papers and Talks</a>) &bull; (<a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/CV_GeorgeHSeelinger.pdf">CV</a>)</h2>
		<p>I am interested in problems involving algebraic combinatorics. Recently, I have been working on problems in the following areas.
		  <ul>
			  <li> Macdonald polynomials and positivity questions: finding new ways to examine symmetric functions related to Macdonald polynomials and understand why they expand positively into certain distinguished bases.</li>
			  <li> Catalan functions: finding new applications to existing open problems involving symmetric functions.</li>
			  <li> Schubert calculus (and its generalizations): finding symmetric function representatives for Schubert classes in order to prove new results.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Also, as a resource for my cohort of graduate students, but also for other learning graduate students, I worked with various collaborators on creating class notes for first and some second year PhD program courses. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-notes">First year course notes</a>.</p>
		<p>I also publicly post monographs I write for myself to clarify concepts and fill in details of books I read. You can see them here: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/monographs">Monographs</a>; I also have made select notes for more advanced classes I have taken, but they are more likely to have errors and some are incomplete: <a href="http://ghseeli.github.io/grad-school-writings/class-notes">Advanced course notes</a>.</p>
	<h2>Teaching &bull; (<a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/teaching/teaching.html">All</a>)</h2>
		<p>I am not teaching for the 2023--24 academic year.</p>
	<h2>Engagement, Outreach, and Service</h2>
		<p>At UM, I am a co-organizer for a <a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/seminars/learn_alco23_24.html">learning seminar in algebraic combinatorics</a>. I also co-organized a learning seminar in <a href="https://ghseeli.github.io/seminars/learn_alco22_23.html">AY22--23</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sunita-chepuri/learning-seminar">AY21--22</a>. </p>

		<p>In Fall 2023, I supervised five undergraduate students for a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html">Lab of Geometry at UM</a> project on quantum Schubert polynomials. Ultimately, this project yielded a combinatorial construction for the monomial expansion of quantum Schubert polynomials. <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/math-assets/logm/fa%2723/logm-quantum-schubert-polys.pdf">Project proposal</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16168">Resulting arXiv preprint</a>.</p>

		<p>I sometimes make contributions to the open source mathematical software <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, including overhauling the <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.html">diagram algebras package</a> with my collaborators as a result of my work on Brauer algebras and implementing <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/partition_shifting_algebras.html">Young's raising operators</a> with my collaborators on projects involving Catalan functions. If you are interested in contributing code to Sage, check out <a href="sage/sage_checklist">my development checklist</a> and feel free to contact me if you have questions!</p>

		<p>In graduate school, I was a member of and webmaster for the UVA <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/awm/">Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)</a>. AWM works to encourage girls and women to study and have activer careers in the mathematical sciences and promote equal opportunity and equal treatment of girls and women in the mathematical sciences.</p>

		<p>Previously, I volunteered as a <a href="http://indorgs.virginia.edu/MathAmbassadors/">UVA Math Ambassador</a> to do math outreach in Charlottesville area grade schools.</p>

		<p>Previously, I have been a mentor for the UVA Math Department <a href="http://math.virginia.edu/drp/">Directed Reading Program (DRP)</a>. The DRP pairs undergraduates interested in learning math outside the standard curriculum with graduate student mentors who guide them in reading some interesting and different mathematics. For instance, I mentored a student about the theoretical foundations of machine learning, culminating in understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine">SVM classification algorithm</a> and the theoretical justification for SVM as a classifier. </p>

	<h2>Other Activities</h2>
	        <p>I actively maintain <a href="https://github.com/ghseeli/latex2blender">latex2blender</a> with my friend <a href="https://peterkj1.github.io/">Peter Johnson</a>. This project facilitates easy importation of arbitrary LaTeX fragments into <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, an open source 3D modeling program.</p>

		<p>For fun, I also enjoy being outdoors, playing video games, traveling, and reading books.</p>
