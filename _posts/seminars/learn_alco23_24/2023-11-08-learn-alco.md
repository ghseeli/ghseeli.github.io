A del Pezzo surface can be obtained by blowing up the projective plane at points in general position. Such a surface contains lines that come from the point configuration in \\(P^2\\). We can also define a moduli space of del Pezzo surfaces as the parameter space of these point configurations. In this talk, we work over the real numbers and study real del Pezzo surfaces and the regions on them cut out by the lines; we also study the moduli space of real del Pezzo surfaces. In both cases, we find positive geometries. This is joint work with Nick Early, Alheydis Geiger, Marta Panizzut, and Bernd Sturmfels.
