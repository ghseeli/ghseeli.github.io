About
---
For this course, Matthew Lancellotti and I created [notesheets](https://mareoraft.github.io/MATH-Calc/1220.html) for students to follow along with lecture and to facilitate group learning techniques, such as group problem solving to break up lectures following the "think-pair-share" model.

I also facilitated a Slack channel to encourage students to collaborate outside the classroom and to allow all students to benefit from hints and clarifications I provided outside the classroom. 

The Course Webpage was faciliatated through UVA's course management system, UVA Collab.
