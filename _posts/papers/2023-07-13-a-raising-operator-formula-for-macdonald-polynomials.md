Abstract: We give an explicit raising operator formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials \\(\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)\\), which follows from our recent formula for \\(\nabla\\) on an LLT polynomial and the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula expressing modified Macdonald polynomials as sums of LLT polynomials.  Our method just as easily yields a formula for a family of symmetric functions \\(\tilde{H}^{1,n}(X;q,t)\\) that we call \\(1,n\\)-Macdonald polynomials, which reduce to a scalar multiple of \\(\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)\\) when \\(n=1\\). We conjecture that the coefficients of \\(1,n\\)-Macdonald polynomials in terms of Schur functions belong to \\(\mathbb{N}[q,t]\\), generalizing Macdonald positivity.
