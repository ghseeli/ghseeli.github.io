SageMath Permutation Tutorial
====

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free and open source computer algebra system built on top of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). For this tutorial, we will use a website called [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) which allows you to use SageMath from your web browser.

Using CoCalc
----

1. Go to [https://cocalc.com/](https://cocalc.com/) and sign up for an account.

    </details>
1. Once you log in, you will be presented with your "Projects" page. Click "Create New Project" and call it "Algebraic Combinatoric Class" or something else descriptive for yourself.

        <img src="../img/cocalc-projects-2.png" alt="CoCalc Projects Page"/>
    </details>
1. A project is a collection of documents and worksheets. Create a new worksheet by clicking the blue (+) icon on the top left.

        <img src="../img/cocalc-files-3.png" alt="CoCalc Files Page"/>
    </details>
    
    - Name it "test"
    - Select "Sage worksheet" for the type
    
    <details>
        <summary> Image </summary>
        <img src="../img/cocalc-new-file-4.png" alt="CoCalc New Worksheet"/>
    </details>
1. Now it should open the worksheet automatically with a single cell. Type "2+2" and then hit "Shift+Enter". It should output "4".

        <img src="../img/cocalc-worksheet-5.png" alt="CoCalc worksheet"/>
    </details>
1. You are now ready to go through the Permutation Tutorial worksheet [here](https://cocalc.com/share/495b25fe-5784-4f66-94ea-ecb0da67fa42/permutations-tutorial-read-only.sagews?viewer=share)
    - Copy the worksheet into your CoCalc project by hitting "Open in Cocalc" on the top right.
    
    <details>
        <summary> Image </summary>
        <img src="../img/cocalc-open-in-cocalc-6.png" alt="Open public sheet in Cocalc"/>
    </details>
    
    - Then, click on the little "Page" button below the "Files" button on the top left and select "Copy..."
    
    <details>
        <summary> Image </summary>
        <img src="../img/cocalc-file-menu-7.png" alt="File menu in Cocalc worksheet"/>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary> Image 2</summary>
        <img src="../img/cocalc-copy-8.png" alt="Copy button on file menu in Cocalc worksheet"/>
    </details>
    
    - In the "Copy" pane, set "In the project" to "Algebraic Combinatorics Class" or whatever you named your project. Leave the "Destination" field empty.
    - Now, click "Projects" in the top left corner and navigate to your "Algebraic Combinatorics Class" project. The permutations-tutorial.sagews should now be in your files list. Open it!
    - Follow the instructions to practice doing combinatorics with SageMath!
