We will define quivers and their representations and use examples to gain intuition. We will then define algebraic objects associated to quivers (the path algebra and the \\(K\\)-group) and use these to state the standard representation of a quiver and explore properties of the category of quiver representations. This talk will cover sections 1.1--1.4 of Quiver Representations and Quiver Varieties by Alexander Kirillov Jr.
