In Fall 2018, I was a mentor for the UVA Math Department [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](http://math.virginia.edu/drp/). The DRP pairs undergraduates interested in learning math outside the standard curriculum with graduate student mentors who guide them in reading some interesting and different mathematics.

I mentored an undergraduate student in a project on some theoretical background of machine learning, in particular for [Support Vector Machines (SVMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine). Our reading followed the textbook "Foundations of Machine Learning" by Mohri, Rostamizadeh, and Talwalkar (1st edition) and covered roughly chapters 1--5.
